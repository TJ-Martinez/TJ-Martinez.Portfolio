                Hi, My name T.J. Martinez. Although my real name is, Antonio Lira Martinez Jr.
                So now, you're probably wondering, "Who is T.J.?" Or better "What is T.J.?" Or even better, "Why is T.J.?" (Avengers reference anyone? If not,  <a width="50" height="50" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQpWRenGF_w?start=66"  target="_blank"> Here </a> )
                T.J. stands for Tony Jr. Yup, super simple, just Tony Jr. Named right after the man I call father. I guess it was some small town inclination in the 90's but everyone and their daddy's were naming their first sons Jr. 
                Can you imagine? There was a B.J., A.J., L.J., G.J., and all the letters of the alphabet.J. I'm not mad about it or anything, I just didn't feel like the O.G. (or more like O.J. "Original Jr.") of my group of friends.
                <br> <br>
                So, I needed to do something to go beyond the ordinary. Something that set me apart from the other Jr's. Lo and behold, I get into U.T! Queue the screams of joy and laughter, woooo! I was ready to do amazing things and...nope. Eight years ago, I moved to Austin, started my college life, took my first classes of the semester, failed two of my classes, cried a lot, and gave up. Ok...yeah...not exactly the "dream." The pressure of being a top student was relentless. I'm suppose to be the guy everyone was expecting great things from. So this fail hit really hard, like Britney Spears 2007 hard. I stopped going to school for a year. I started working at H-E-B as a cashier and
                living off paycheck to paycheck. I was suppose to be this big time geologist traveling the world and making that money at the age of 22. But, life did not go as planned. This was a hard lesson learned. Now it's time for a new proclamation (low key proclamation) to myself and that is to strive for success. I need to get out of this rabbit hole of misery. I may have taken a major "L" but now it's time to bounce back. I am here to change my attitude and my career.
