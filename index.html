                Hi, I'm T.J. Martinez. Although my real name, Antonio Lira Martinez Jr. 
                <br><br>
                You are probably wondering, "Who is T.J.?"" Or better "What is T.J.?"" Or even better, "Why is T.J.?" (Avengers reference anyone? If not, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQpWRenGF_w"> Here</a>)
                T.J. stands for Tony Jr. Yup, super simple, just Tony Jr. Named right after the man I call father. I guess it was some small town inclination but everyone and their daddy's were naming their first sons Jr. 
                Can you imagine? There was a B.J., A.J., L.J. and even a G.J. (always thought saying G.J. was kind of awkward). Anyways, my name is just two simple letters.
                <br> <br>
                My name maybe simple, but I plan on making it big, yet subtle, like low key big. I just want to be the guy that every gets a long with and can pop open a bottle with from time to time. Not only do I want to increse my connects, it is also my goal to make something that benefits society. Although I don't know what that is yet, hopefully, I will meet the right people that'll lead me to that goal.
