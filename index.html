                Hi, My name T.J. Martinez. Although my real name, Antonio Lira Martinez Jr.
                So now, you're probably wondering, "Who is T.J.?"" Or better "What is T.J.?"" Or even better, "Why is T.J.?" (Avengers reference anyone? If not, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQpWRenGF_w"> Here</a>)
                T.J. stands for Tony Jr. Yup, super simple, just Tony Jr. Named right after the man I call father. I guess it was some small town inclination but everyone and their daddy's were naming their first sons Jr. 
                Can you imagine? There was a B.J., A.J., L.J., G.J., and all the letters of the alphabet.J. Anyways, I'm not mad about it or anything, I just didn't feel like the O.G. (or more like O.J. "Original Jr.") of my group of friends.
                <br> <br>
                I needed to do something to go beyond the ordinary. So, I got into U.T! Wooo, super excited, going to do amazing and...nope. Eight years ago, I moved to Austin, took my first classes of the semester, failed my 1st class, cried a lot, and gave up. Ok...yeah...not exactly the "dream," but I didn't expect to fail so hard. In high school I was always winning. I was the smart one. The guy everyone expected to do great things. So this fail hit really hard, like Britney Spears 2007 hard. I stopped going to school for a year. I started working at H-E-B as a cashier and
                living off paycheck to paycheck. I was suppose to be this big time geologist traveling the world and making that money at the age of 22. But, life did not go as planned. Hard lesson learned. Good thing I have learned now and not later. I may have taken a major "L" but now it's time to bounce back. I am here to change my attitude and my career.
