                    Hello, my name is Antonio Lira Martinez Jr, but I like to go by T.J. I'm from a small town called, Uvalde,Tx. My small town is known for its hunting grounds, rivers, and ranching. All things that I never really was a part of. I mean I enjoyed fishing, swimmng, and go to my grandma's ranch, but I felt like I didn't really belong there. 
                <br> <br>
                Moved to Austin around 2010 and it was everything I expected to be, weird and crazy. I have experienced a lot of things, things that I never really thought I would enjoy. I look forward to gaining new experiences and friends.
